Mountains is a project with the aim of discovering global climbing communities.

The project is built scraping data from various sources on the internet, including 8000ers.com and Wikipedia. Once stored in a Google Sheets, before Kumu reads the data and displays in a map. Mountain data includes their names, heights, countries, fatalities and ranges. Climber data includes names, descriptions, images and life status. Lastly ascent data is stored as climbers, mountains, dates, and whether or not it was a first ascent.
